# printf
In this project we will develop the activity 0x11. C - printf from Holberton School. In which we had to develop a printf with all its characteristics; including type of format, length modifiers, etc.

Project information 
Below, additional information that we had to take into account in order to develop the project, such as requirements and resources, will be presented. As well as the contact of the developers of this project.

Compilation Process:
''' gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c

Requirements:
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called holberton.h
Don’t forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded
Note that we will not provide the _putchar function for this project

Resources:
write: man 3 write
malloc: man 3 malloc
free: man 3 free
va_start: man 3 va_start
va_end: man 3 va_end
va_copy: man 3 va_copy
